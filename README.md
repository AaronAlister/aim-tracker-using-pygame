**Aim Trainer**
Aim Trainer is a real-time aim training application built with Python and Pygame, designed to simulate fast-paced target acquisition while capturing meaningful performance metrics. The project emphasizes accuracy tracking, reaction consistency, and session-level analytics, serving as a foundation for data-driven evaluation and future AI-based enhancements.

**Features**
1) Real-time gameplay loop running at 60 FPS
2) Dynamic target spawning with hit and miss detection
3) Lives-based scoring system with controlled difficulty
4) Post-game analytics dashboard displaying:
   Accuracy percentage
   Targets per second
   Total hits and session duration
5) Modular architecture for easy extension and experimentation

**Project Focus**
Beyond gameplay, Aim Trainer prioritizes performance measurement and feedback, mirroring evaluation pipelines used in machine learning systems. The collected metrics can be extended toward adaptive difficulty scaling, player modeling, or AI-assisted performance analysis, aligning the project with Generative AI and Computer Vision workflows.
