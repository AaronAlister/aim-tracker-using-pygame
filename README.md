## Tech Stack
- Python  
- Pygame  

---

## Features
- Real-time gameplay loop running at 60 FPS  
- Dynamic target spawning with hit and miss detection  
- Lives-based scoring system with controlled difficulty  
- Post-game analytics screen displaying:
  - Accuracy percentage  
  - Targets per second  
  - Total hits  
  - Session duration
